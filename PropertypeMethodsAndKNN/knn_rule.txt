A famous result of Cover and Hart (1967) shows that asymptotically the
error rate of the 1-nearest-neighbor classifier is never more than twice the
Bayes rate.

Many additional results of this kind have been derived; Ripley (1996) sum-
marizes a number of them.

5-knn is the best in LANDSAT.

We can use knn/tangent_distance to do zipcode classification.
