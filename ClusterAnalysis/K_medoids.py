For not quantitative variables（cannot compute variable mean）.

'''
1. For a given cluster assignment C find the observation in the cluster
minimizing total distance to other points in that cluster.

2. Given a current set of cluster centers {m 1 , . . . , m K }, minimize the to-
tal error by assigning each observation to the closest (current) cluster
center.

3. Iterate steps 1 and 2 until the assignments do not change.
